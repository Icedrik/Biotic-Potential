    <p>Biotic Potential is the intrinsic reproductive capacity of each species (depends on genetically determined physiological properties). genetically determined physiological properties). The biotic potential of a species is not constant, but varies according
        to the environmental conditions, which are affected by the population increase. In any case, it is of interest to know the biotic potential of a species. In any case, it is of interest to know the maximum or potential biotic potential (obtained
        under ideal laboratory laboratory conditions) because when comparing it with the real biotic potential (obtained in the field, under natural conditions), an estimation of natural conditions), an estimation of environmental resistance can be obtained
        (Morláns, 2004) </p>
    <p>Clearly the biotic potential indicates the growth capacity of a population but like any population it must have limitations or variables that allow this behavior to be constant, which will be the environmental resistance that regulates the growth
        of the population.</p>
