    <p align="center">In a population it is very common to study structural characteristics such as age and gender ratios where everyone has their own way of organizing and analyzing.</p>

    <p align="justify">But there are also factors within a population that are fluctuating or dynamic over time which give information such as growth rate, birth rate, death rate. The idea of this project is to allow the calculation of a characteristic of a population which
        allows to make projections about the number of individuals over time and the growth rate of the population. This characteristic is known as biotic potential. It also seeks to provide a tool that facilitates the calculation of certain variables
        that are of great importance in different fields such as environmental engineering.
